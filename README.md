## Neural Style transfer

Introduction:

Objective: 
To explore neural style transfer with different deep neural nets (dnns), and identify the one that leads to more appealing results.

Approach:
Code neural style transfer in a friendly manner â€“ easily go from one dnn to another
Identify significantly different images (2 content, 2 style)
Run each model for the 4 combinations, tuning each combination individually to yield the best possible result.

Conclusion:
VGG16 seems to be the best at generating appealing images.

Next Steps: 
Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform style transfer.
Try fast artistic style transfer on videos.
